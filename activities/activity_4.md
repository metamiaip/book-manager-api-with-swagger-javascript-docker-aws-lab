## ðŸ’¿ Exercise 4.1 - Database connection

The current deployment is using the **.env** environment file that points at the in memory database.

As an extension see if you can follow through the instructions again BUT this time try to deploy 
your application so that it points to your real database. 

ðŸ™Œ Top Tip: Have a look at the `docker run` command

ðŸ™Œ Top Tip: Don't forget to terminate your application once you've finished.
