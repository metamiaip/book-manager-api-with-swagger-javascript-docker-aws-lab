## ðŸ’¾ Pointing at your real database

## ðŸ’¿ Exercise 4.1 - Database connection

The current deployment is using environment variables that point at the in memory database.

As an extension see if you can follow through the instructions again BUT this time try to deploy 
your application so that it points to your real database. 

ðŸ™Œ Top Tip: Remove those **Software configuration** variables you populated when you created the application on Elastic Beanstalk

ðŸ™Œ Top Tip: Don't forget to terminate your application once you've finished.
